I am an engineer, turned neuroscientist, turned data scientist. I work at Biogen,
as Konectom's Head of Data Science, where I lead a team of brilliant Data Scientists
who are trying to discover new ways of assessing and monitoring the impact of
neurological diseases on patients' lives.

I am a founding director of [SPiKE.AI](https://www.spike.ai), where we provide
machine learning services to innovating companies. I also worked as an independent
consultant for a few French companies here in Paris.

I was a research associate in the [Department of Clinical and Experimental
Epilepsy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/departments/epilepsy) at University College
London, [Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion). I worked on
mutations affecting ion channels (mainly potassium channels) and how they might
affect synaptic transmission.

Before this post-doc, and during my PhD and first post-doc at [Imperial College
London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk), I investigated the basic biophysical
constraints faced by axons, and how these constraints have shaped the trade-offs
made by neurons. I investigated these trade-offs using stochastic simulations
based on biophysical data found in literature. The simulations are carried on
using [Modigliani](http://www.modigliani.co.uk), our in-house stochastic
simulator.

I am a research associate in
the [Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/departments/epilepsy) at
University College London, [Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion).
I investigate the basic biophysical constraints faced by axons, and
how these constraints have shaped the trade-offs made by neurons. I
investigate these tradeoffs using stochastic simulations based on
biophysical data found in literature. The simulations are carried on
using [Modigliani](http://www.modigliani.co.uk), our in-house
stochastic simulator.

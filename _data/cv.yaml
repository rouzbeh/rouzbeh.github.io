  title : Research associate
  place : University College London
  date : 2015
  location : UK
  description : >
     I was part of a large project investigating the impact of mutations on
     synapses in mammalian CNS. My role consisted in formulating novel hypotheses
     based on models I developed during my PhD and testing them in an
     experimental setting.

  title : Research associate
  place : Imperial College London
  date : 2014
  location : UK
  description : >
     This position was an opportunity to
     continue working on projects started during my
     PhD. Notably:
      comparative study of metabolic cost and reliability of action
       potential transmission in myelinated and unmyelinated axons using
       stochastic simulation.
      - Impact of channel noise on the waveform of action potentials
       and EPSPs
      - Homeostatic constraints on the function of neural fibres

  title : PhD student in computational neuroscience
  place : Imperial College London
  date : 2010-2014
  location : UK
  description : >
     My research focused on biophysical constraints faced by neural fibres
     (energy, noise, time and volume), and how evolution of nervous
     systems reflects trade-offs between those constraints.  I maintained
     and developed libraries for stochastic simulation of ion channels
     and neural fibres (Modigliani, available from modigliani.co.uk) and
     used them to simulate models that I created based on experimental
     data.

     I specialised in theoretical computer science, including a
     course on non-classical programming paradigms (Erlang, Haskell,
     Lisp, etc.) I successfully completed the embedded systems module
     (ROSE), and followed Dr. Dessalles's courses on artificial
     intelligence and cognitive sciences.
